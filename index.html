<h2>Domestic Dogs</h2>
<p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)is a member of the genus Canis (canines),which forms part of the wolf-like canids,and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxaas modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>

                                <h3 id="ety">Etymology</h3>
                                <p id="etyp">The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[22] The term may derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkōn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle")[23] or (as suggested by Piotr Gąsiorowski) the Old English colour adjective dox, meaning "brown" or "tan".[24] In either case, the word seems to have been derived via the diminutive suffix -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.[25]</p>
                                    <h3 id="tax">Taxonomy</h3>
                                    <p>In 1758, the taxonomist Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the classification of species. Canis is a Latin word meaning dog,[33] and under this genus he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and on the next page as a separate species he classified the wolf as Canis lupus.[2] In 1926, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) ruled in Opinion 91 that the domestic dog Canis familiaris be placed on its official list.[3] In 1957, the ICZN ruled in Opinion 451 that Canis dingo was the name to be used for the dingo and that this be placed on its official list.[34] These are the scientific names for the dog and dingo that appear on the Official Lists and Indexes of Names in Zoology of the ICZN.[35]</p>

                                                    <p>Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb) and was 250 cm (98 in) from the snout to the tail.[56] The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the shoulder.[57]</p>

                                                        <li><em>Tail</em>
                                                            <p>There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.[63] In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.[64]</p>

                                                                            The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[87][88][89][90] Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.
                                                                            
                                                                            The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.[90]
                                                                            
                                                                            The longest-lived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.[90] The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[88][89][90][91] The dog widely reported to be the longest-lived is "Bluey", who died in 1939 and was claimed to be 29.5 years old at the time of his death. On 5 December 2011, Pusuke, the world's oldest living dog recognized by Guinness Book of World Records, died aged 26 years and 9 months.[92]</p>

Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[77] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[78] It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.</p>
